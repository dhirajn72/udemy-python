python2 vs python3
------------------
Year of Release	
    Python 2 was released in the year 2000.	

    Python 3 was released in the year 2008.

“Print” 
    Keyword	In Python 2,print is considered to be a statement and not a function.	In Python 3, print is considered to be a function and not a statement.


Storage of Strings	
In Python 2, strings are stored as ASCII by default.	In Python 3, strings are stored as UNICODE by default.


Division of Integers	
On the division of two integers, we get an integral value in Python 2. For instance, 7/2 yields 3 in Python 2.	On the division of two integers, we get a floating-point value in Python 3. For instance, 7/2 yields 3.5 in Python 3.


Exceptions	In Python 2, exceptions are enclosed in notations.	In Python 3, exceptions are enclosed in parentheses.


Variable leakage	The values of global variables do change in Python 2 if they are used inside a for-loop.	The value of variables never changes in Python 3.


Iteration	In Python 2, the xrange() function has been defined for iterations.	In Python 3, the new Range() function was introduced to perform iterations.


Ease of Syntax	Python 2 has more complicated syntax than Python 3.	Python 3 has an easier syntax compared to Python 2.


Libraries	A lot of libraries of Python 2 are not forward compatible.	A lot of libraries are created in Python 3 to be strictly used with Python 3.


Usage in today’s times	Python 2 is no longer in use since 2020.	Python 3 is more popular than Python 2 and is still in use in today’s times.


Backward compatibility	Python 2 codes can be ported to Python 3 with a lot of effort.	Python 3 is not backward compatible with Python 2.


Application	Python 2 was mostly used to become a DevOps Engineer. It is no longer in use after 2020.	Python 3 is used in a lot of fields like Software Engineering, Data Science, etc.
